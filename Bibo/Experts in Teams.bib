	abstract = {In this contribution we develop and analyse intelligent control methods in order to optimise the energy efficiency of a modern residential building with multiple renewable energy sources. Because of alternative energy production options a non-convex mixed-integer optimisation problem arises. For the solution we first apply combined optimisation methods and integrate it into a model predictive controller. In comparison, a reinforcement learning based approach is developed and evaluated in detail. Both methods, in particular reinforcement learning approaches are able to decrease energy consumption and keep thermal comfort at the same time.},

	abstract = {District heating is used in many urban areas in Sweden. Almost always, the district heating utility is owned by the municipality and the municipality naturally encourages proprietors to connect their buildings to the grid, even if they cannot really force them to do so. The building owners are free to choose the best system, i.e. the cheapest one, for their need. Unfortunately, it is not always so easy to ﬁnd the best solution. Mixed integer linear programming ({MLIP}) models might here come to help. By such computer programs it is possible to ﬁnd the absolutely cheapest system of available alternatives, or even combinations among them. This paper shows how to design such a model and further how to closely depict the district heating, and electricity tariff. This is of course very important because the only interface between the proprietor of the building and the utility is found in this bureaucratic instrument. If the tariff is too high the building owners will choose other heating systems than district heating, or even worse, combining district heating with alternative base load sources. In Sweden, this has been of interest because ground-water coupled heat pumps can be proﬁtable, operated by use of the relatively low electricity prices. In this paper we show that dual-fuel, and sometimes even triple-fuel systems, are of interest when the proprietor aims at minimising the cost for space and domestic hot-water heating.},

	abstract = {This article considers heat transfer in a solid body with temperature-dependent thermal conductivity that is in contact with a tank filled with liquid. The liquid in the tank is heated by hot liquid entering the tank through a pipe. Liquid at a lower temperature leaves the tank through another pipe. We propose a one-dimensional mathematical model that consists of a nonlinear {PDE} for the temperature along the solid body, coupled to a linear {ODE} for the temperature in the tank, the boundary and the initial conditions. All equations are converted into a dimensionless form reducing the input parameters to three dimensionless numbers and a dimensionless function. A steady-state analysis is performed. To solve the transient problem, a nontrivial numerical approach is proposed whereby the differential equations are first discretized in time. This reduces the problem to a sequence of nonlinear two-point boundary value problems ({TPBVP}) and a sequence of linear algebraic equations coupled to it. We show that knowing the temperature in the system at time level n − 1 allows us to decouple the {TPBVP} and the corresponding algebraic equation at time level n. Thus, starting from the initial conditions, the equations are decoupled and solved sequentially. The {TPBVPs} are solved by {FDM} with the Newtonian method.},
